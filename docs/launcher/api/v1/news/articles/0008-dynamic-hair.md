### Dynamically Transforming Hair

___

In the upcoming Revamp CaC Overhaul, it will finally be possible to change your hairstyle in-game and have the transformed counterparts change dynamically depending on whichever hairstyle you choose, completely seamlessly! We hope this is something others can also build upon in the future, we're excited to share it with you all.

We know this is a feature that many Xenoverse 2 fans have wanted since Xenoverse 1 first released, and we're excited to be able to provide it for you all. A huge thank you to [@o0DemonBoy0o](https://twitter.com/o0DemonBoy0o) without him this would never have been possible.
